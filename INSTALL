Thank you for helping me test this plugin!


Requirement:
Your vim should be compiled with python interface, 
you should make sure that pygtk and python-dbus has already been installed

To install this plugin:
1. copy doc and plugin folder into ~/.vim
2. copy dbus_gdb any where you like, then in your VIMRC file, please add:
let g:gdb_dbus_server_path = 'Your path to the dbus_gdb/gdb_dbus_server.py'

Then just enjoy.
