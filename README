This is actually my first script, so please give me your feedbacks and say whatever you like and whenever you want to!

Written with python, this script implements few basic functions in debugging, such as:
1. Add a variable display
2. Set/clear breakpoint
3. step/next
4. edit the value of a variable (since 0.023)
